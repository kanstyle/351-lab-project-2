		<h1>Strangeness</h1>
		<p>Things may sometimes not appear correct as you remember them. It's difficult for humans to remember sequences of numbers. Sometimes, if the numbers are switched, you don't know. You may have been asleep when this happened, and nobody else saw it either. This is a strangeness because you don't know. You might not be able to know.</p>
		<h2>Sequence (a place)</h2>
		<p>5 3 6 7 1 2 0 9 1 7 (est. West 21st Street, New York City, NY, cyclical appearance)</p>
		<p><n></n>Is it the same? When did you look at it last? If it were to change, is the meaning the same, in your mind? It might be hard to remain calm when you don't know. You might feel as if something's been taken from you, even though everything is right here. (Please scroll down!)</p>
